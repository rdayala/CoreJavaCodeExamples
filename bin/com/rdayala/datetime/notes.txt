Fundamental concepts :

As humans, we are trained to think date and time in terms of months, days, years, and hours so on...

For computers, this kind of interpretation is not easy to represent.

So, they modeled time as a single large number representing a point on a continuous timeline. Arbitrarily, epoch is set as an origin.

epoch is set at - January 1, 1970 UTC(midnight).

In computers, time is measured relative to epoch.

A day has 86400 seconds. (24 hours * 60 mins * 60)

UTC - short for coordinated Universal Time.
International Time standard.

UTC time is measured by atomic clocks which are highly precise. 
There are around 70 UTC timing centers around the world and there is an organization called BIPM uses the times that are reported by
these different timing centers to compute the exact UTC time.

Computers have their own internal clocks to compute UTC time and they're good at reflecting UTC time.

JVM implementations also do not handle leap seconds.

Calendar systems :

Solar
	Gregorian - widely used.
			Leap year divisible by 4 or 400, but not 100
	Julian
			Leap year exactly divisible by 4

Lunar - followed by Islamic

LuniSolar - Buddhist, Chinese, Hindu Lunisolar, Hebrew, etc.

Java8 Date and time API uses ISO 8601 standard based on Gregorian calendar.
